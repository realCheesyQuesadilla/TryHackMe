What is the latest version of NFS? [released in 2016, but is still up to date as of 2020] This will require external research.
  4.2

Conduct a thorough port scan scan of your choosing, how many ports are open?
  7
Which port contains the service we're looking to enumerate?
  2049
Now, use /usr/sbin/showmount -e [IP] to list the NFS shares, what is the name of the visible share?
  /hpme
Time to mount the share to our local machine!

First, use "mkdir /tmp/mount" to create a directory on your machine to mount the share to. This is in the /tmp directory- so be aware that it will be removed on restart.

Then, use the mount command we broke down earlier to mount the NFS share to your local machine. Change directory to where you mounted the share- what is the name of the folder inside?
  └─$ sudo mount -t nfs 10.10.37.212:/home /tmp/thmmount -nolock
  
Have a look inside this directory, look at the files. Looks like  we're inside a user's home directory...

Interesting! Let's do a bit of research now, have a look through the folders. Which of these folders could contain keys that would give us remote access to the server?

Which of these keys is most useful to us?
  .ssh
Copy this file to a different location your local machine, and change the permissions to "600" using "chmod 600 [file]".
  id_rsa
Assuming we were right about what type of directory this is, we can pretty easily work out the name of the user this key corresponds to.

Can we log into the machine using ssh -i <key-file> <username>@<ip> ? (Y/N)
  y
