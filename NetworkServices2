What is the latest version of NFS? [released in 2016, but is still up to date as of 2020] This will require external research.
  4.2

Conduct a thorough port scan scan of your choosing, how many ports are open?
  7
Which port contains the service we're looking to enumerate?
  2049
Now, use /usr/sbin/showmount -e [IP] to list the NFS shares, what is the name of the visible share?
  /hpme
Time to mount the share to our local machine!

First, use "mkdir /tmp/mount" to create a directory on your machine to mount the share to. This is in the /tmp directory- so be aware that it will be removed on restart.

Then, use the mount command we broke down earlier to mount the NFS share to your local machine. Change directory to where you mounted the share- what is the name of the folder inside?
  └─$ sudo mount -t nfs 10.10.37.212:/home /tmp/thmmount -nolock
  
Have a look inside this directory, look at the files. Looks like  we're inside a user's home directory...

Interesting! Let's do a bit of research now, have a look through the folders. Which of these folders could contain keys that would give us remote access to the server?

Which of these keys is most useful to us?
  .ssh
Copy this file to a different location your local machine, and change the permissions to "600" using "chmod 600 [file]".
  id_rsa
Assuming we were right about what type of directory this is, we can pretty easily work out the name of the user this key corresponds to.

Can we log into the machine using ssh -i <key-file> <username>@<ip> ? (Y/N)
  y

First, change directory to the mount point on your machine, where the NFS share should still be mounted, and then into the user's home directory.

Download the bash executable to your Downloads directory. Then use "cp ~/Downloads/bash ." to copy the bash executable to the NFS share. The copied bash shell must be owned by a root user, you can set this using "sudo chown root bash"
  chmod +s bash
Now, we're going to add the SUID bit permission to the bash executable we just copied to the share using "sudo chmod +[permission] bash". What letter do we use to set the SUID bit set using chmod?
Let's do a sanity check, let's check the permissions of the "bash" executable using "ls -la bash". What does the permission set look like? Make sure that it ends with -sr-x.
  -rwsr-sr-x
Now, SSH into the machine as the user. List the directory to make sure the bash executable is there. Now, the moment of truth. Lets run it with "./bash -p". The -p persists the permissions, so that it can run as root with SUID- as otherwise bash will sometimes drop the permissions.

Great! If all's gone well you should have a shell as root! What's the root flag?
  THM{nfs_got_pwned}

What does SMTP stand for?
  Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
What does SMTP handle the sending of? (answer in plural)
  emails
What is the first step in the SMTP process?
  smtp handhshake
What is the default SMTP port?
  25
Where does the SMTP server send the email if the recipient's server is not available?
  smtp queue
On what server does the Email ultimately end up on?
  pop/imap
Can a Linux machine run an SMTP server? (Y/N)
  y
Can a Windows machine run an SMTP server? (Y/N)
  y
  

First, lets run a port scan against the target machine, same as last time. What port is SMTP running on?
  25
Okay, now we know what port we should be targeting, let's start up Metasploit. What command do we use to do this?
  msfconsole
If you would like some more help or practice using Metasploit, TryHackMe has a module on Metasploit that you can check out here:

https://tryhackme.com/module/metasploit
Let's search for the module "smtp_version", what's it's full module name?
  auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_version
Great, now- select the module and list the options. How do we do this?
  options
Have a look through the options, does everything seem correct? What is the option we need to set?
  RHOSTS
Set that to the correct value for your target machine. Then run the exploit. What's the system mail name?
  polosmtp.home
What Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) is running the SMTP server? This will require some external research.
  postfix
Good! We've now got a good amount of information on the target system to move onto the next stage. Let's search for the module "smtp_enum", what's it's full module name?
  auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum
We're going to be using the "top-usernames-shortlist.txt" wordlist from the Usernames subsection of seclists (/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames if you have it installed).

Seclists is an amazing collection of wordlists. If you're running Kali or Parrot you can install seclists with: "sudo apt install seclists" Alternatively, you can download the repository from here.

What option do we need to set to the wordlist's path?
  USER_FILE
Once we've set this option, what is the other essential paramater we need to set?
  RHOSTS
Now, run the exploit, this may take a few minutes, so grab a cup of tea, coffee, water. Keep yourself hydrated!

Okay! Now that's finished, what username is returned?
  administrator
  
  

What is the password of the user we found during our enumeration stage?
  alejandro

Great! Now, let's SSH into the server as the user, what is contents of smtp.txt
  THM{who_knew_email_servers_were_c00l?}



What type of software is MySQL?
  relational database management system
What language is MySQL based on?
  sql
What communication model does MySQL use?
  client-server
What is a common application of MySQL?
  back end database
What major social network uses MySQL as their back-end database? This will require further research.
  facebook


As always, let's start out with a port scan, so we know what port the service we're trying to attack is running on. What port is MySQL using?
  3306
Good, now- we think we have a set of credentials. Let's double check that by manually connecting to the MySQL server. We can do this using the command "mysql -h [IP] -u [username] -p"

Okay, we know that our login credentials work. Lets quit out of this session with "exit" and launch up Metasploit.

We're going to be using the "mysql_sql" module.

Search for, select and list the options it needs. What three options do we need to set? (in descending order).
  PASSWORD/RHOSTS/USERNAME 
Run the exploit. By default it will test with the "select version()" command, what result does this give you?
  5.7.29-0ubuntu0.18.04.1
Great! We know that our exploit is landing as planned. Let's try to gain some more ambitious information. Change the "sql" option to "show databases". how many databases are returned?
  4
